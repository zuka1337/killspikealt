This is spike, alternative and easy external page for exclude high values from an rrd graph.

It works with any rrd from rrdtool.
You can use the interface which is easy to setup or the bash script only on linux machine.

There is no secret using this.

The script works passing $1 variable to the script ex:

.spikekill /path/path/example.rrd

Spike field: You can insert one and only spike path
MultiSpike: You can insert as much as you want to.
